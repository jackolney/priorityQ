// 3) Test out including function pointers in here too. = Done.
// 4) Transition to multiple cpp files. = Done.
// 5) Supply time and function reference in event class constructor. = Done.
// 5) Including a "currentTime" we walk through time and execute the top of the queue, pop it off and continue. = Done.
// 6) Include a PERSON. = Done.
// 7) Assign characteristics to an instance of person at initialisation. = Done.
// 8) Allow events (derived from class event) to act upon person. = Done.
// 9) Run two people on one eventQ with a GlobalTime. = Done.
// 10) Set up ages to run properly. = Done.
// 11) DeathDates should be MINUS initialAge (convert to days too). = Done.
// 12) Allow UpdateQ() to run -> perhaps to remote functions. = Done.
// 13) Allow cohorts to be fired off at different times. <- CHALLENGE NOW.
//		-> cohort constructor defines a startTime = Done.
//		-> startTime then entered into theQ = Done.
//		-> at the correct time theQ calls cohort->GeneratreCohort(); = Done.
// 14) Stagger start of individuals in each cohort (spread throughout the year). = Done.
//		-> Stagger over the period of one year. = Done.
//		-> Make sure age / death date / events are all ON TOP of this date. = Done.
// 15) Multiple cohorts over time. <- TARGET! = Done.
// 16) Age structure in 1970 for time == 0. = Done.
// 17) Allow events to be cancelled. = Done.
// 18) Seed HIV incidence.
//		-> Create hiv.h and Hiv(). = Done.
//		-> Schedule HivIncidence each year. = Done.
// 19) How to handle multiple events occuring on the same day? (non-issue).
// 20) Allow person to be part of a COHORT. = Done.
// 21) Scope to allow HIV to be acquired sometime during the year. = Done.
// 22) EXPAND to include all functions of the model.
//		-> Only allow Cd4Testing if HIV-positive. = Done.
//		-> Ensure that I reuse as much code as possible.
//
//			---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//			>> NATURAL HISTORY:
//				-> UpdateCd4Count() = Done.
//				-> UpdateWhoStage() = Done.
//				-> ForArtToo... ensure that disease progression occurs properly. = Done.
//				-> Flags for checking too? = Done.
//				-> Each event with competing events supplies additional info to the event which is checked in CheckValid() prior to Execute(); = Done.
//				-> Put DATE for NH events in constructors for events?. = Done.
//				-> CHECK THAT WHEN ON ART... REVERSE HAPPENS AS EXPECTED. = Done.
//			---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//			>> CASCADE:
//				-> HivTesting (HCT / VCT / PICT); = Done.
//					-> Separate events for each Test. Execute() specifies time delay and probability of entering Care and receiving CD4 test. = Done.
//				-> Cd4Testing (care etc.) = Done.
//					-> ONE EVENT for all CD4 testing. -> Need a testing route flag on person (for retention purposes). = Done.
//				-> Cd4Results = Done.
//				-> LTFU. (in progress).
//				-> Pre-ART Care Retention. = Done.
//				-> ART Initiation. = Done.
//				-> ART dropout. = Done.
//				-> Update AGE in each step ( I think I need to apply this to NH and Cascade events ). = Done.
//				-> Ensure that as patient becomes symptomatic a PICT trigger is enabled. (and cascade event triggers). = Done.
//				-> Check that all times and proportions are correct. = Done.
//				-> ART Adherence (challenge). = Done.

//				-> DALYs between 2010 and 2030. = Done.
//				-> Cost between 2010 and 2030. = Done.
//				-> Care experience of those died between 2010 and 2030. = Done.
//				-> Account for art dropout and return in costs. = Done.
//			---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//			>> R-TOOLS:
//				-> Specific functions that will run theQ->RunEvents() with a different set of parameters and spit-back different things (DALYs or COST etc.)
//			---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//			>> INTERVENTIONS:
//				-> Include 12 interventions.
//				-> Intervention scenarios.
//			---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//			-> An HIV-test through ANY route (each route should have a separate event but should all call a HivTest function.
//		-> Need a more solid end point (break;) in the code
//			-> Inclusion of HIV-related death date.
//		-> Make more use of Cancel() for overriding competing hazards in the model.
//		-> Costs / DALYs - can I calculate costs from the clinic perspective?
